# Numerical Algorithms

This repository contains projects (*excluding the analysis of obtained results for now*) written in Java. 

## Project 1
The aim of the project is to demonstrate rounding errors and method errors in calculating the value of the cosine function using a power series, by summing the elements of this series in various ways. The program calculates one million cosine values from the range of $$[-2\pi, 2\pi]$$ using the built-in Java function and four different custom functions. The results are saved to the cosine.txt file. The analysis is performed using a Python script (to be added later).
